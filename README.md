Work in progress! Not yet functional.

The Digico S series consoles have very limited OSC commands. Except that the iPad application is exchaging data as OSC with almost all possible commands.
This application is a server that connects in between the console and the iPad app and that allows you to inject OSC commands from other applications.

Future devevelopments will include personal monitoring.
